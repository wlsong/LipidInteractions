This folder stores PIP2 interactions with A2aR in three conformations, i.e. inactive, active and active in complex with mini Gs. The lipid interaction data were generated by PyLipID based on coarse-grained simulations with complex membranes.

"POP2" was the residue name used by MARTINI coarse-grained force field for PIP2 molecules that contain one palmitoyl tail and oleic tail.
